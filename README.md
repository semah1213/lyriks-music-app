# React 18, Tailwind, and Shazam Core API Integration

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to integrate React 18, Tailwind CSS, and the Shazam Core API using RapidAPI. The Shazam Core API allows you to identify music tracks based on audio samples.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A RapidAPI account with access to the Shazam Core API. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for free at [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/).
- Your Shazam Core API key. You can obtain this key from your RapidAPI dashboard.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/semah1213/lyriks-music-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project's directory:

   ```bash
   cd lyriks-music-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following:

   ```bash
   REACT_APP_SHAZAM_API_KEY=YOUR_SHAZAM_API_KEY
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_SHAZAM_API_KEY` with your actual Shazam Core API key.

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application in action.

## Building the Project

To build the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized version of the project in the `build` directory.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up a React 18 project with Tailwind CSS and integrated the Shazam Core API using RapidAPI. Feel free to explore the code and customize it according to your needs.
